# Building-Neural-Network-from-Scratch
This project implements a fully customizable feed forward neural network from scratch, providing a foundation for deep learning understanding. The code supports dynamic neural network configurations, allowing for customization of hyperparameters like learning rate, number of layers, input/output units, and training epochs.
